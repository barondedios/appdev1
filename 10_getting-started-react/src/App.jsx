      <h2>Why I want to learn React?</h2>

      <h6>
       I'm excited to learn React because, not only this is our AppDev's topic this semester, but also because I want to build interactive web applications, and I’ve heard it’s one of the most in-demand skills in modern web development. I also enjoy working on front-end projects and making them dynamic and user-friendly and I think this will build my fundamentals and foundation needed to kickstart my career in IS.
