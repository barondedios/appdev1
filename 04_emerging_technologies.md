# Example: Fifth-Generation Mobile Network (5G)

## Introduction

5G (Fifth-Generation Mobile Network) is the latest standard in wireless communication, offering faster speeds, lower latency, and greater connectivity compared to previous generations.

As you can see in the image above, 5G is being applied to almost everything that we can see. 5G provides such technologies the ability to function faster and in real-time with almost no connection issues at all. It is used for faster and efficient Tracking, Sensors, Inspection, and etc.

5G has been making quite an impact in the industrial IoT, from providing a more secured tracking for vehicles and parcels, to providing efficient sensors and enhanced security with very low latency that allows very little errors to occur at all. 

Back then, IoT or even IT doesn't exist in the Industrial Period, where work and labor are done with pretty much no modern technology at all. But now, IT have seeped in the Industrial Business that IT(People) will always be involved in always making new technologies like these and providing them maintenance.

## Purpose

Its main goals are:
- Ultra-fast data transfer for seamless communication
- Low-latency performance for real-time applications
- Massive device connectivity to support IoT ecosystems
- Enhanced bandwidth for high-quality streaming and interactive experiences

5G aims to transform the way people, devices, and systems connect, enabling advanced applications in both education and IT industries.

## Usage

- **In Education**:  

  AI is utilized in education to personalize learning experiences. Platforms like **Duolingo** use AI to tailor language lessons based on user progress. AI algorithms analyze student performance in real-time and adjust lesson difficulty accordingly. Similarly, **Squirrel AI** provides adaptive learning systems that modify content to suit a student's learning pace and understanding.

- **In IT**:  

Like what we have said in the Introduction before, IT have been making a very significant impact in the Industrial Business that almost all of Industrial Businesses are integrated with technologies that help them perform labor and services more efficient, practical, and more advanced.

An example for this would be:

Back then, Internet doesn't exists yet, and there are no online delivery system or even online ordering systems, which is very different from now because ordering and delivery system have become much more seamless than before. Providing us hassle-free shopping and also providing the Industrial Business to track their vehicles and goods.
